# Smart Incident Management System

## Overview

The **Smart Incident Management System** is designed to manage and predict incidents in real-time using a combination of machine learning and real-time data streaming. The system allows users to report incidents, view real-time updates, and receive predictive analytics to optimize resource allocation.

## Features

- **Incident Reporting**: Users can report incidents including their type, location, severity, and status.
- **Predictive Analytics**: The system uses a machine learning model to predict incidents based on incoming data.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The system provides real-time updates to all connected users using Socket.IO.
- **Resource Management**: Track and manage resources like emergency vehicles, optimize their allocation based on predictions.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartIncidentManagementSystem.git
cd SmartIncidentManagementSystem


2. Backend Setup (Node.js)
Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary dependencies:

cd backend
npm install

Running the Node.js Backend
node index.js
This will start the Node.js server on http://localhost:5000.

3. Predictive Analytics Setup (Flask)
Navigate to the analytics_backend directory and set up the Python environment:
cd ../analytics_backend
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install Flask scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib

Running the Flask App
python app.py or you can use py app.py


This will start the Flask server on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

4. Testing the Integration
Test Node.js Backend: Open Postman or use curl to interact with the endpoints exposed by the Node.js server.

Example:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"feature1": 2, "feature2": 3}' http://localhost:5000/api/predict
Test Flask App: The /predict endpoint is integrated with the Node.js server. Any prediction request sent to Node.js will be forwarded to Flask for processing.

5. Real-Time Features
The Node.js server uses Socket.IO for real-time communication. As incidents are reported or predictions are made, connected clients will receive real-time updates.

6. Frontend Setup (React)
To be implemented. The frontend will display real-time updates and allow users to report incidents.

Future Enhancements
Complete Frontend Implementation: Build a React.js frontend to visualize incidents, resources, and predictions.
Advanced Predictive Modeling: Improve the machine learning model with more data and advanced algorithms.
Deployment: Deploy both backend services (Node.js and Flask) to a cloud environment.

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
MongoDB Warnings: The Node.js application may show deprecation warnings related to MongoDB connection options. These can typically be ignored, or you can update the MongoDB driver.
Flask Debug Warnings: Flask will warn about using the development server in production. For production use, a WSGI server like Gunicorn should be used.

# Smart Incident Management System

## Overview

The **Smart Incident Management System** is a full-featured platform designed to manage, predict, and respond to incidents globally. The system integrates real-time data, advanced machine learning models, and resource optimization algorithms to provide a comprehensive solution for incident management.

This project showcases a wide range of skills, including frontend development, backend engineering, data science, machine learning, user management, and global deployment.

## Features

### Core Features

- **Incident Reporting**: Users can report incidents with detailed information including location, type, severity, and time.
- **Real-Time Incident Monitoring**: A dashboard that tracks and displays incidents on an interactive map.
- **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Users can filter and search incidents by date, type, severity, location, and status.

### Data Science & Machine Learning

- **Incident Prediction**: Machine learning models predict incidents based on historical data and real-time inputs (e.g., weather, traffic).
- **Resource Optimization**: Algorithms optimize the deployment of resources based on incident predictions and real-time data.
- **Heatmaps and Risk Analysis**: Visualize high-risk areas and resource allocations with heatmaps and risk analysis tools.

### User Management & Security

- **Authentication and Roles**: Secure user authentication with roles (Admin, Analyst, Field Agent) to control access levels.
- **Audit Trails**: Track and log all actions within the system for accountability.

### Global Integration & Deployment

- **Multilingual Support**: Support multiple languages to cater to a global audience.
- **Global Data Integration**: Integrate with external APIs (e.g., weather, traffic) for real-time data collection.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Deploy the application on cloud platforms with CI/CD pipelines, ensuring high availability and global accessibility.

2. Backend Setup (Node.js)
Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary dependencies:

cd backend
npm install

Running the Node.js Backend
node index.js
This will start the Node.js server on http://localhost:5000.

3. Predictive Analytics Setup (Flask)
Navigate to the analytics_backend directory and set up the Python environment:
cd ../analytics_backend
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install Flask scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib

Running the Flask App
python app.py or you can use py app.py


This will start the Flask server on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

4. Testing the Integration
Test Node.js Backend: Open Postman or use curl to interact with the endpoints exposed by the Node.js server.

Example:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"feature1": 2, "feature2": 3}' http://localhost:5000/api/predict
Test Flask App: The /predict endpoint is integrated with the Node.js server. Any prediction request sent to Node.js will be forwarded to Flask for processing.

5. Real-Time Features
The Node.js server uses Socket.IO for real-time communication. As incidents are reported or predictions are made, connected clients will receive real-time updates.

6. Frontend Setup (React)
To be implemented. The frontend will display real-time updates and allow users to report incidents.

Future Enhancements
Complete Frontend Implementation: Build a React.js frontend to visualize incidents, resources, and predictions.
Advanced Predictive Modeling: Improve the machine learning model with more data and advanced algorithms.
Deployment: Deploy both backend services (Node.js and Flask) to a cloud environment.

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
MongoDB Warnings: The Node.js application may show deprecation warnings related to MongoDB connection options. These can typically be ignored, or you can update the MongoDB driver.
Flask Debug Warnings: Flask will warn about using the development server in production. For production use, a WSGI server like Gunicorn should be used.
